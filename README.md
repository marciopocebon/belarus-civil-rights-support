# belarus-civil-rights-support

This is an attempt to build a crowdfunding platform that allows gathering funds for people who lose their jobs because of their civil position, which isn't aligned with the official position of the Belorussian government. 

The project is in the early stage of development and needed contributors. Please, see [Issues](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/belarus-civil-rights-support/issues) for more details.
